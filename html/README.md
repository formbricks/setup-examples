# HTML Integration with Formbricks

This repository is an example of how we integrated Formbricks with an HTML file.

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide to integrate Formbricks in your app, please refer to the official [Formbricks HTML Guide](https://formbricks.com/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#HTML).

## Setup Instructions we Followed

1. Edited the Formbricks Enviornment ID and API Host

2. It's HTML ;), we just launched the file!

Just with the above, we had a running HTML file with Formbricks integrated.
