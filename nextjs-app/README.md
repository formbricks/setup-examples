# NextJs App Directory Integration with Formbricks

This repository provides an example of how to integrate Formbricks with a NextJS application with the App directory configuration.

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide, please refer to the official [Formbricks NextJs Guide](https://formbricks.com/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#next-js).

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new NextJs application:

   ```sh
   npx create-next-app@latest
   ```

2. Navigate to the created application directory:

   ```sh
   cd nextjs-app
   ```

3. Install the Formbricks JS library:

   ```sh
   npm install --save @formbricks/js
   ```

4. Start the NextJs development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

With these steps, you should have a running NextJs application with Formbricks integrated. If you run into any issues, reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://formbricks.com/discord).
