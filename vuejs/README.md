This repository provides an example of how to integrate Formbricks with a VueJs application.

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide, please refer to the official [Formbricks VueJs Guide](https://formbricks.com/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#vue-js).

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new React application:

   ```sh
   npm create vue@latest
   ```

2. Navigate to the created application directory:

   ```sh
   cd vuejs
   ```

3. Install existing dependecies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the Formbricks JS library:

   ```sh
   npm install --save @formbricks/js
   ```

5. Start the React development server:

   ```

With these steps, you should have a running VueJs application with Formbricks integrated. If you run into any issues, reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://formbricks.com/discord).
